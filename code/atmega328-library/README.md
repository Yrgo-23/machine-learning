The code is written in C++17 and adapted for Microchip Studio.  

The library includes the following drivers:  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **ADC:** Driver for the ATmega328P ADC.  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **EEPROM:** Driver for utilization of the ATmega328P EEPROM.  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **GPIO:** Generic driver for GPIO devices.  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **Timer:** Driver for the ATmega328P hardware timers.  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **Serial:** Driver for serial transmission via USART.  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **Watchdog:** Driver for the ATmega328P watchdog timer.  

The library includes the following generic containers:  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **Array:** Implementation of static arrays of any data type.  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **CallbackArray:** Implementation of callback arrays of arbitrary size.  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **List:** Implementation of doubly linked lists of any data type.  
    &emsp;&emsp;- **Pair:** Implementation of pairs containing values of any data type.
